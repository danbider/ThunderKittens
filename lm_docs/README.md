This folder contains documentation we've generated to help LLMs like Claude write ThunderKittens kernels.

It turns out they're actually also useful for people, too! But please be warned: because these are generated by and for LLMs, their correctness has not been checked quite _as_ thoroughly as we would do for documentation written by and for humans.
